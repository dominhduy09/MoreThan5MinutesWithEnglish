Edible and eatable both refer to something that is "able to be eaten," 
but edible is usually used to describe something that is
safe to eat, without regard to taste, 
while eatable often describes something that has some level of acceptable flavor
. Likewise, inedible often refers to something toxic or unsafe, while uneatable refers to food that tastes bad.
